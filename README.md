## How the app works

Full stack web application that allows you to store famous burger names. Once the burger is created, it will be stored in the database and the burger will be added to the `Burgers on the list` section which will be located on the left. Each burger in the list has a `Devour` button. Clicking this button will move the burgers from the list to the right side of the screen `Yummy!!` section. The list on the right is a list of all the burgers that have been devoured. Each burger on this list has a `Delete` button that allows you to remove the burger from the page and database as well.
